# Interview Scheduler
The Scheduler is an interview appointment creation tool. It uses REACT to create a responsive Single page app. 
The main functionality of the app is the creating, deletion and editing of interviews. Account management is not included in the functionality. All data is stored and retrieved from a database API.

Technologies used include React, SASS, WebPack, Babel, Axios client-side, Node.js, Express, Postgres server-side, Storybook, Testing Library, WebPack Dev Server, Jest, and Cypress for development and testing.

Interview Scheduler is not suitable for real-world production use and is only for demonstration and educational purposes.
